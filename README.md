## How to build/run
You can build from scratch using `javac` or just run the makefile with `make`. You have the following options:
* `make`: which will compile the program and create a .class file
* `make run`: which will compile and automatically run the program with all required arguments (RECOMMENDED)
* `make clean`: which will clean up any build files (just .class in this case) 

Note: after unzipping the main folder, you may have to run:
* `chmod +w project`: if the permission to write does not already exist
